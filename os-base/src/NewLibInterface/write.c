// Firmware based os. No file support. Minimal implementation

/*
From the https://sourceware.org/newlib/

Write to a file. libc subroutines will use this system routine for output to all files, including stdoutâ€”so if you need to generate any output,
 for example to a serial port for debugging, you should make your minimal write capable of doing this. 

 The following minimal implementation is an incomplete example; it relies on a outbyte subroutine (not shown; typically, 
 you must write this in assembler from examples provided by your hardware manufacturer) to actually perform the output. 


int _write(int file, char *ptr, int len) {
  int todo;

  for (todo = 0; todo < len; todo++) {
    outbyte (*ptr++);
  }
  return len;
}

// Do nothing
int _write(int file, char *ptr, int len) {
  return -1;
}
